# Project name: Workout Tracker  


# Project description
In this project we are working on a web application to track workouts, fitness activities, and nutrition.
The user will be able to register and log workouts corresponding to a date to track progress. User can also access their workout history using various parameters like workout type, day, frequency of each type, muscle targeted. The total workout time will also be logged to track effectivenes of each workout.  At its core, this is a workout and nutrition Tracker, and we plan to add other functions like suggesting workouts on the basis of the user's workout history, suggestions on the ideal exercise times for the user in the future.
