## üîß Issues Planned to Address

1. *User Login & Session Management*  
   - Implement user authentication via email and password.  
   - Establish session management where a session token (cookie-based authentication) is generated upon successful login.  
   - Ensure persistent login by storing and validating session cookies.  

2. *User Registration*  
   - Develop a sign-up feature that captures essential details: *Email, First Name, Last Name, and Password*.  
   - Implement email validation to prevent duplicate accounts.  
   - Securely store user credentials using password hashing (e.g., *bcrypt*).  

3. *OTP-Based Authentication*  
   - Integrate *one-time password (OTP) verification via email* for user authentication.  
   - OTP expiration and invalidation mechanisms to enhance security.  

4. *Forgot Password Functionality*  
   - Enable users to reset their password using a *password reset link or OTP* sent to their registered email.  
   - Implement secure token-based password reset flow with expiration.  

5. *UI/UX Design with Figma*  
   - Create high-fidelity *Figma designs* for user authentication screens, including:  
     - *Sign Up Page*  
     - *Login Page*  
     - *Forgot Password Page*  

6. *Frontend Implementation*  
   - Develop *React-based frontend* for user authentication.  
   - Implement responsive UI components for a seamless user experience.  
   - Use *React Router* for page navigation and *Redux/Context API* (if required) for state management.  

7. *Frontend & Backend Integration*  
   - Establish API communication between frontend and backend using *RESTful APIs* or *GraphQL*.  
   - Secure API endpoints with *JWT-based authentication*.  
   - Implement error handling and response validation on the frontend.  

8. *Swagger API Documentation*  
   - Integrate *Swagger (OpenAPI)* for API documentation.  
   - Enable automatic API contract generation for easy debugging and testing.  
   - Provide example request-response structures for better API usability.  

9. *Profile Deletion*
   - User should be able to delete profile.

## ‚ùå Not Completed
1. *OTP-Based Authentication*  
   - *Email OTP verification* was not implemented due to prioritization of basic authentication.  
   - Future plans to include *OTP-based login for enhanced security*.  

2. *Forgot Password Functionality*  
   - The password reset flow using *OTP or token-based authentication* was not fully implemented because I want to do it using kafka and had trouble implementing it.  
   - Future implementation will include *email-based password reset with expiration*.  

3. *Swagger API Documentation*  
   - API documentation using *Swagger (OpenAPI)* was not integrated because I was having trouble understanding it.  
   - Future enhancements will include *automatic API contract generation and request-response documentation*.¬†¬†
